# Landscape-Design-Roof-Garden

This project explores my final landscape design kayout in designing given a space in a Roof Garden settings

## Skills Demonstrated:

### User-Centric Design Approach:
In landscape design, I aim to understand the needs and behaviors of the people (users) who will occupy the space, therefore designing the environment based on this requirement. Example, having a playground in the roof garden to allow families to bring their kids there to use the playground. Benches and pathing designs were also designed through taking into account based on human activity and circulation flow such as having a running track around the garden.

### Spatial & Information Architecture:
With proper Spatial diagram design the circulation of the user, the plants, pathways and focal points are designed in a cohesive layout to ensure a smooth navigation and balanced design. Trees planted were designed to ensure it met the safety requirement of the weight load requirement on a roof garden. 

### Iterative Design Process:
Multiple sketches, diagrams were done before finalizing the plan, this is similar to wireframing and prototyping. This is what I would consider a high fidelity prototype.

### Attention to Detail & Documentation
In this project, I maintained clear documentation of materials, and design rationale as well as the accurate measurements of height and width for every product in the landscape design. Such as the path width, size of playground, gazebo area and planting space.
